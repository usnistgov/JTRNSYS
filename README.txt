Loosely-coupled integration of TRNSYS and Java-based applications using Type277. 
 
Type277 utilizes socket communication to provide loosely-coupled integration between TRNSYS and Java-based components. 
Bi-directional flow of information is facilitated using the client-server architecture of Java. Type277 is compiled as 
both a 32-bit and 64-bit dynamic link library to support co-simulation with TRNSYS17 and TRNSYS18 projects. An application 
of Type277 is demonstrated by modifying an example TRNSYS project. The Java project and files, TRNSYS modified example 
projects, and Type277 dynamic link libraries are being made available to the public through the NIST GitHub site. 

The instructions for using Type277 is documented in: NIST TN 2053.pdf included in the project. It can also be downloaded
from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2053

When you are using Type277 in your project please cite the NIST TN 2053 document as a reference.
